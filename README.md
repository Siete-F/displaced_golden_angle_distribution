# displaced_golden_angle_distribution
The golden angle is a special value that comes back in nature more times than you can imagine. I will (again) use it to derive a leave pattern for a lamp design.

In this repository, please take a look at `plot_golden_angle_dist.R`, if you are curious for the code.
It contains the main function that creates a plot.
It's only dependency is 'pracma', a package from CRAN providing the 'interp1' (one dimensional interpolation) feature. This I use for applying a displacement to the natural order of things :)

The function `./displaced_golden_angle_distribution.R` calls some plots, and when set on 'save_file = T', will create the files that are stored in the './fig/' folder.

Later on I will create some gif files from then, potentially erase them again, and explain the design choices etc.
When the project is ongoing or finished, I will share some pictures of the end result to.
